# Hash-Calculator

## Project Description 

A hash calculator is a tool used to generate hash values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom input data. These hash values ‚Äã‚Äãare fixed sequences of characters (usually in hexadecimal) that represent the unique digital fingerprint of the data.


This project aims to explain the principle of ransomware and I developed it as part of my studies, to learn how it works.

## Uses of a Hash Calculator :

   - It's up to you to have fun

## Explanations

1. Importing modules:

```
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
import hashlib
```

2. Utility functions:

**choose_file():** Opens a dialog box to choose a file and updates the text entry with the path of the selected file.

**hash_file(file_path, hash_type):** Reads the file in 4096-byte chunks, updates the hash, and returns the hashed value in hexadecimal.

**hash_button_click():** Retrieves the selected file path and hash type, and displays the hash result in a dialog box.

3. Creating the user interface:

- **file_label, file_entry**, file_button for file selection.
- **hash_label, hash_md5, hash_sha1**, hash_sha256 for hash type selection.
- **hash_button** to start the hash.
